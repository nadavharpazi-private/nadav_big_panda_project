steps to build and run program:
===============================

1. git clone:
https://github.com/nadavharpazi-private/nadav_big_panda_project.git

2. compile and build project (easiest is to use already existing IntelliJ project),
assuming JDK 1.8 is installed

3. running on windows:
go to the root directory of the project and run:
java.exe -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath out\artifacts\big_panda_project_jar\big_panda_project.jar big_panda_project.main

4. running on mac:
go to the root directory of the project and run:
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath:out/artifacts/big_panda_project_jar/big_panda_project.jar big_panda_project.main

5. optional parameters:
debug_level <level> (possible values are: 0/1/2/3/4/5, default is 1, which is debug)
port <port number> (default is 9000)

6. running example:
===================
to run on windows, on port 8000, with verbose debug level, run:
java.exe -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath out\artifacts\big_panda_project_jar\big_panda_project.jar big_panda_project.main debug_level 0 port 8000

7. To access the stats API, go to http://localhost:9000/stats
(or http://localhost:8000/stats if port was changed as in the example above)

8. final question:
"3 things you would improve in your submission.":
1. I would check if the current performance is good enough (product wise), and if needed scale up the solution with full multi-threading.
2. I would complete timers, logging and debug.
3. I would complete tests: unit tests, integration tests, etc. I have written only one test file as an example.
